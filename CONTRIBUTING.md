# Contribution guidelines

This is an open and collaborative project, and any suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

If you're making a pull request, please ensure it adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Check if the link is working and pointing to the right location.
2. Check your spelling and grammar.
3. The list, after your addition, should be sorted alphabetically.
4. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
5. If you use a text editor to fashion the pull request, make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
6. New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization, are welcome.
7. Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
8. Use the following format for the commit message: `Add Company Foo.io` (without 'awesome' or something else).
9. Keep descriptions short, sweet and to the point.
10. Use the following format: 
	1. `[Name](link) - Description.` keep the length of the name + description under 100 characters
	2. `[Values](link).` 
	2. `[Culture](link). ` 
	2. `[Glassdor/Comparably (score)](link).` If applies 
11. Any new entry should have meaningful content at the time of the addition to this list. We can't tell whether something is awesome if there is little to see. As a general rule, there should be at least about six months worth of content.
12. Companies in this list should have "remote DNA". This means they are not only remote friendly, but dedicated to remote work as a core of their business.
13. Link to the career/job page rather than to a single job post.
14. No agencies, please.
